## Description:

This application is to schedule out your work day. The current date is displayed at the top of the application and will always show the current date. There are time blocks from 9am-5pm that allow the user to input their schedule for that day. Next to the textarea field, there is a save button that will save whatever is inputted into the textarea. When the save button is clicked it will save that information to the localstorage and hold that information when the page is refreshed. There are also different colors that will show in the time blocks depending on what time of day it is. These different colors are represented by past, present, and future. Past tasks will show up light grey, present tasks will show up red, and future task will show up green. This will allow the user to have a clear and easy way to see what task they are on and what is upcoming.
